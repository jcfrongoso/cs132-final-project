By examining the growth and distribution of various marine species across different regions, we aim to provide data-driven insights into the viability of further investment in Philippine aquaculture.</p> <h2 class="mb-2">Rationale</h2> <p class="mb-4">There are three fisheries sectors in the Philippines: municipal fisheries, commercial fisheries, and aquaculture.</p> <p class="mb-4">As of 2024, <strong>approximately 64.1%</strong> of the total volume of fisheries productions comes from aquaculture, contributing 683,934.30 Metric Tons of production. Despite a -7.3% decrease of production from 2023 to 2024, aquaculture still remains effective as a constant and reliable source of fish, especially for a country that subsists on a fish-based protein diet.</p> <p class="mb-4">An attribution to its rising increase of production are due to overfishing and illegal fishing practices that destroy marine environment, which leads to less hauls for other fisheries sectors. This also includes rising sovereignity tensions between the Philippines and the China for control of the West Philippine Sea, driving away local fishers from their designated areas. This, in turn, creates a need for adaptation to aquaculture practices.</p> <p class="mb-4">The United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report titled "<em>The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2024</em>" released in June 2024 also highlights Philippines as one of the few nations to dominate the global aquaculture industry. In order for the Philippines to capitalize future positive market implications, the shift towards aquaculture requires proper investments in infrastructure, training for local fishermen to transition smoothly and sustainably from recent events, and finding specific trends that will boost existing aquaculture production.</p> <p class="mb-4"><em>References:</em> <!></p></div>`);function fe(p){let o=0,l=()=>(o++,o);const n=["https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/countrysector/naso_philippines","https://psa.gov.ph/statistics/fisheries-situationer","https://www.bfar.da.gov.ph/2024/02/07/bfar-eyes-100-food-fish-sufficiency-by-2028/","https://ispweb.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/philippine-fisheries-dynamics-market-shifts-aquaculture-update-sovereignty-concerns-solar-projects-and-project-lead/","https://earthjournalism.net/stories/rich-seas-poor-fishers-the-impact-of-fisheries-subsidies-in-the-philippines","https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/1793345"];var r=pe(),s=e(t(r),14),d=e(t(s),2);E(d,1,()=>n,I,(c,i)=>{var m=me(),f=t(m);a(m),O(g=>{h(m,"href",k(i)),D(f,`[${g??""}]`)},[l],N),q(c,m)}),a(s),a(r),q(p,r)}var ve=P('<h4 class="underline">Null Hypothesis</h4> <p class="min-h-0 sm:min-h-30"> </p> <h4 class="underline">Alternative Hypothesis</h4> <p class="min-h-0 sm:min-h-20"> </p>',1),ge=P('<div><h3> </h3> <p class="min-h-0 sm:min-h-15"> </p> <!></div>'),be=P('<div class="max-w-5xl mx-auto"><div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-8"><div><h1 class="mb-4">Problem</h1> <p class="mb-4">Philippines already has an domineering aquaculture production, but recent statistical data shows a decrease in production a year prior.</p></div> <div><h1 class="mb-4">Solution</h1> <p class="mb-4">By analyzing previous quarterly data about aquaculture, the group aims to find specific parameters and analyze trends that could have affected the value and volume of production.

Before proceeding to the four major steps, a preliminary check was done on both datasets to gain a brief understanding about the structure and format of both datasets.</p> <ul class="list-outside list-disc"><li>The first step done was to check the structure of both datasets. On our Colab notebook, we were able to identify that both datasets have the same structure: both contains species, geolocation, and the quarterly values/volumes for each species/geolocation grouping and a wide formatting due to the nature on how quarterly value/volumes were structured.</li> <li>The second step was to identify missing values and apply imputation, if necessary. It was found out that both datasets contain missing values in the form of 
            ".." strings. From here, we preprocess those strings in such a way that we could apply KNN imputation to fill up the gaps. This method of imputation was used because standard imputation methods, such as mean, mode, median, backward, and forward fill, may lead to reduced variance and a possibility of data leakage. KNN imputation utilizes other features to identify what value to use instead of relying on one column to infer what value to impute that's why it was chosen as the method for imputation.</li> <li>The third step done was to reformat the columns and the dataset themselves. We've skipped the outlier part since these values may have been caused by outside interactions/factors. We also took note of the source for these datasets because the sampling and collection weren't done by our group but rather by professional individuals which means that the values provided on these datasets are reliable and consistent. Based on the values of the Species column, we can remove leading periods. The same goes with the Geolocation column. After reformatting both columns, we transform the wide formatted dataset into long formatting using melt() in order to properly structure the datasets into a format suitable for time-series analysis.</li> <li>The fourth step was to combine both datasets into a finalized dataset that will be used for the analaysis step.

With around 7000 islands in the country, there is in no doubt that aquaculture is a thing on our regions.
