By examining the growth and distribution of various marine species across different regions, we aim to provide data-driven insights into the viability of further investment in Philippine aquaculture.</p> <h2 class="mb-2">Rationale</h2> <p class="mb-4">There are three fisheries sectors in the Philippines: municipal fisheries, commercial fisheries, and aquaculture.</p> <p class="mb-4">As of 2024, <strong>approximately 64.1%</strong> of the total volume of fisheries productions comes from aquaculture, contributing 683,934.30 Metric Tons of production. Despite a -7.3% decrease of production from 2023 to 2024, aquaculture still remains effective as a constant and reliable source of fish, especially for a country that subsists on a fish-based protein diet.</p> <p class="mb-4">An attribution to its rising increase of production are due to overfishing and illegal fishing practices that destroy marine environment, which leads to less hauls for other fisheries sectors. This also includes rising sovereignity tensions between the Philippines and the China for control of the West Philippine Sea, driving away local fishers from their designated areas. This, in turn, creates a need for adaptation to aquaculture practices.</p> <p class="mb-4">The United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report titled "<em>The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2024</em>" released in June 2024 also highlights Philippines as one of the few nations to dominate the global aquaculture industry. In order for the Philippines to capitalize future positive market implications, the shift towards aquaculture requires proper investments in infrastructure, training for local fishermen to transition smoothly and sustainably from recent events, and finding specific trends that will boost existing aquaculture production.</p> <p class="mb-4"><em>References:</em> <!--[--><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="font-medium text-blue-600 hover:underline" href="https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/countrysector/naso_philippines">[1]</a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="font-medium text-blue-600 hover:underline" href="https://psa.gov.ph/statistics/fisheries-situationer">[2]</a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="font-medium text-blue-600 hover:underline" href="https://www.bfar.da.gov.ph/2024/02/07/bfar-eyes-100-food-fish-sufficiency-by-2028/">[3]</a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="font-medium text-blue-600 hover:underline" href="https://ispweb.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/philippine-fisheries-dynamics-market-shifts-aquaculture-update-sovereignty-concerns-solar-projects-and-project-lead/">[4]</a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="font-medium text-blue-600 hover:underline" href="https://earthjournalism.net/stories/rich-seas-poor-fishers-the-impact-of-fisheries-subsidies-in-the-philippines">[5]</a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="font-medium text-blue-600 hover:underline" href="https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/1793345">[6]</a><!--]--></p></div><!----></section> <hr class="w-48 h-1 mx-auto my-4 bg-gray-100 border-0 rounded-sm md:my-10 dark:bg-gray-300"> <section class="my-8 pt-20 mx-8 sm:mx-auto" id="Problem"><div class="max-w-5xl mx-auto"><div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-8"><div><h1 class="mb-4">Problem</h1> <p class="mb-4">Philippines already has an domineering aquaculture production, but recent statistical data shows a decrease in production a year prior.</p></div> <div><h1 class="mb-4">Solution</h1> <p class="mb-4">By analyzing previous quarterly data about aquaculture, the group aims to find specific parameters and analyze trends that could have affected the value and volume of production.

The first dataset contains the value of each aquaculture specie for each region while the second dataset contains the volume of each aquaculture specie for each region. The finalized dataset that will be used for analysis contains six columns, namely Species, Geolocation, Year, Quarter, Value, and Volume, and 6800 samples.</p></div><!----></section> <hr class="w-48 h-1 mx-auto my-4 bg-gray-100 border-0 rounded-sm md:my-10 dark:bg-gray-300"> <!--[--><section class="my-8 pt-20 mx-8 sm:mx-auto" id="Preprocessing"><div class="max-w-5xl mx-auto"><h1 class="mb-2">Data Preprocessing</h1> <p class="mb-4">For data preporcessing, four major steps were used on both dataset to arrive on the combined final dataset. Before proceeding to the four major steps, a preliminary check was done on both datasets to gain a brief understanding about the structure and format of both datasets.</p> <ul class="list-outside list-disc"><li>The first step done was to check the structure of both datasets. On our Colab notebook, we were able to identify that both datasets have the same structure: both contains species, geolocation, and the quarterly values/volumes for each species/geolocation grouping and a wide formatting due to the nature on how quarterly value/volumes were structured.</li> <li>The second step was to identify missing values and apply imputation, if necessary. It was found out that both datasets contain missing values in the form of 
            ".." strings. From here, we preprocess those strings in such a way that we could apply KNN imputation to fill up the gaps. This method of imputation was used because standard imputation methods, such as mean, mode, median, backward, and forward fill, may lead to reduced variance and a possibility of data leakage. KNN imputation utilizes other features to identify what value to use instead of relying on one column to infer what value to impute that's why it was chosen as the method for imputation.</li> <li>The third step done was to reformat the columns and the dataset themselves. We've skipped the outlier part since these values may have been caused by outside interactions/factors. We also took note of the source for these datasets because the sampling and collection weren't done by our group but rather by professional individuals which means that the values provided on these datasets are reliable and consistent. Based on the values of the Species column, we can remove leading periods. The same goes with the Geolocation column. After reformatting both columns, we transform the wide formatted dataset into long formatting using melt() in order to properly structure the datasets into a format suitable for time-series analysis.</li> <li>The fourth step was to combine both datasets into a finalized dataset that will be used for the analaysis step.

With proper knowledge and analysis of these features, we get to understand the position of aquaculture systems in our country. We can use this knowledge to identify what key points lead to the increase/decrease of these systems in order to maintain a stable economy.</p> <p class="mb-2">For the first research question, we are dealing with a quantitative independent variable Volume and a quantitative dependent variable Value. Given this, we opted to use linear regression to identify the correlation between the two variables. Using StatsModels API on Ordinary Least Squares, we were able to identify the following results.</p> <p class="mb-2">insert results here</p> <p class="mb-2">Given the summary results provided from our OLS regression, we conclude that we should reject the null hypothesis with $P > |t|$, t-statistic value of 37.296 which is large, and with the 95% confidence interval [0.015, 0.016] not including zero which means that there is a positive correlation between the two.</p></div> <div><h2 class="mb-2">Research Question 2: Is there a significant difference in aquaculture volume across different regions in the Ph?</h2> <h3 class="mb-2">Ho: There is no significant difference in aquaculture volume across different regions in the Philippines.</h3> <h3 class="mb-2">Ha: There is a significant difference in aquaculture volume across different regions in the Philippines.</h3> <p class="mb-2">Now that we've identified that there is indeed a correlation between the two, we can further dive deeper by identifying if there's a significant difference in volume across different regions in the Philippines. Why does this matter? Well, we are an archipelago and it tells a lot about the composition of our geography. With around 7000 islands in the country, there is in no doubt that aquaculture is a thing on our regions. But does that mean that regions that are near coastal or have bodies of water inside them get to utilize them properly, thus a substantial volume? This is what this question asks. We want to know the efficiency if there's a discrepancy between regions.</p> <p class="mb-2">Note that our independent variable here is the geolocation/regions in the Philippines and our dependent variable is aquaculture volume. Given this, we proceed to utilize Kruskal Wallis to test our hypothesis.</p> <p class="mb-2">insert table here</p> <p class="mb-2">Given the H value of 378 which is very large and a p value of $1.41\times 10^-70$, we reject the null hypothesis.
